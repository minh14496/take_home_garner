## Task
Data Scientists at Garner are responsible for building the engine to the Doctor Ranking algorithm. Part of their job is to translate complex medical rules into code that draws information from a vast data repository and distills it into an actionable insight for each doctor. Imagine that you are the lead in developing the ranking for gastroenterology, and you are starting by writing a set of tools to help you gather insights into colonoscopies.

## Exercise
Your task is to create a function, set of functions, or a constructor in Python that translates a medical rule into a performant task (query, pipeline, etc) that traverses a database and returns insights about doctor performance. Your tool(s) should output the historical performance (violation rate) of each doctor, showing how many opportunities a doctor had to follow the rule (the denominator), and how many times they violated the rule (numerator). Whatever you build should also be able to handle similar problems such that a change to the rule (e.g. a new set of diagnosis codes) could be easily implemented. Your solution should be a zipped directory containing the .py file(s) where your function(s) and/or constructor(s) reside, as well as a .py script or .ipynb notebook titled "solution" where you demonstrate how to use your tools.

### A good solution meets the following criteria: 
- Has a notebook/script that calls your function(s) or constructor(s) to produce results
- Has a notebook that analyzes the results 
- Has a .py source file (or files) that contains only your function(s) or constructor(s) that are used in the notebook/script.
- Runs without errors or user input. 
- Has the ability to handle a slightly different rule set.
- Is easily understandable and follows modern best practices.
- Is easily extensible.
- Clearly abstracts the salient features of the problem.
- Predicts a doctorâ€™s future performance based on the historical data.

Feel free to use any packages/libraries that you want, but make sure that you clearly communicate to us if you use a package/library that is not part of the standard data science stack.
